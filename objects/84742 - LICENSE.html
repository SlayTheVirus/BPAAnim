I used the Edge split modifier and subsurf to get the Smooth/hard look I wanted on the model. The actual model is quite lowpoly. The model is fully rigged with a modified Rigify rig. To the contrary of my other headrigs this one relay heavily on shapekeys for the facial expressions. To cut down rendertimes and to try new things in the material editor I used a own made material based on matcaps and I tried to make it easily modified. I'm quite happy about how I got the materials to work.There is some parts I am not pleased with, I would have made the fingers and resting pose different if I started again. My decision to use Rigify instead of building my own rigg from scratch ended up being a problem though it was to complex to modify once generated.I have had a 3 year break from Blender and this project was just what I needed to reignite my Blender lust :)Enjoy.</blockquote><hr /><h3>Help us moderate this file</h3><p>Blend Swap is a place to share and get awesome 3D work, if you think this blend falls into one of the following issues please file a report from <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/84742">http://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/84742</a> by clicking on the <strong>Manage</strong> panel to the left of the blend and then on <strong>Report/Flag</strong>:</p><ul><li>The blend author didn't make this blend and posted it as their own.</li><li>The blend author is violating a Creative Commons License or copyright.</li><li>The blend is incomplete, work in progress, or has missing textures.</li><li>The blend contains simulation cache files and other unneeded media.</li><li>The preview image has nothing to do with the blend's contents.</li></ul><p>Your help allows the site to stay clear of broken and stolen work.</p><hr /><h4>Notes:</h4><ul><li>Do NOT report this blend if you dont' know how to use a feature on Blender, instead use the <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/questions">questions section</a> of the site.</li></ul></article><footer>Original file hosted by <a href="http://www.blendswap.com">Blend Swap, LLC</a>.</footer></body></html>
